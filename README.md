# Wine-Quality-Analysis-Prediction

Here with the help of python libraries and ML algorithm, I am analyzing and predicting the type and quality of the wine presented to us with the data.
I have used all the necessary python libraries like:
### For basic funtionality-
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn

### For exploratory data analysis:
* Matplotlib
* Plotly
* Seaborn
* Cufflinks

### For model building and prediction:
* Sklearn

I have also used different models like RandomForest or Logistic Regression or Extra Tree Classifier and used Hyperparameter tuning to predict a better result with 92% of accuracy.

In the dataset 2 columns can be considered as a label which are:
* Quality ranging from 3 to 9 (only integer values)
* Type of wine (red/white)

For both individual the notebook is created (one for quality and the other for wine).

The dataset is already present in the repository.
But you can also access the same data from kaggle. Link is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality)
